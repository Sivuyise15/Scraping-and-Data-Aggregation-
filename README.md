# Scraping-and-Data-Aggregation-
This project contains a Python Jupyter Notebook that extracts structured data from a publicly accessible websites that allows craping. It demonstrates basic web scraping and HTML tag stripping to retrieve data about customer reviews.

## Files
- webscraping.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook that downloads HTML from a published Google Doc and extracts readable data by removing HTML tags.
- Alternatively you can run it using the file, webscraping.py

## How It Works
- Fetches the HTML content of a public website the requests library.
- Strips HTML tags using regular expressions to convert the content to plain text.
- return  csv file with all the crapped data, in this case customer views information.

## To Test it
- you can use ithis site: https://sivuyise15.github.io/my-website/
- But you can find one other website that stores reviews in that website.
- It is an ongoing project which later on I will advance it.
